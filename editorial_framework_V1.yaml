        Are differing perspectives presented fairly and without distortion?
        Balance does not mean all views are given equal weight—it means relevant and credible perspectives are included in proportion to their evidentiary and civic significance.
        Where views are excluded, the editorial rationale should be evident.
        As Emile Zola put it, art—and by extension, journalism—is 'a corner of reality viewed through a template.' Balance requires awareness of that framing.
